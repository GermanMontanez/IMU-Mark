# IMU-Mark
## Overview
The IMU-MARK is a inertial measure unit developed to tracking the human movement. It combines 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3 axis magnetometer, also have an iNemo module and pressure sensor. Additionally, each sensor have an SPI dedicated in order to get the data and nearly placed for accurate measurements. 

The module is able to send the data in 3 different ways of communication: Bluetooth, serial and radio.

For precision tracking of both fast and slow motions, the parts feature a user-programmable gyroscope full-scale range, a user-programmable accelerometer full-scale range and a user-programmable magnetometer full-scale range.

All sensors and communication modules are controlled by a powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, with DSP instruction support and floating-point unit that allows the processing of complex math functions and handling decimal variables.
